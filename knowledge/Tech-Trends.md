# 2025 Tech Trends Report: Navigating the Era of Living Intelligence

## Executive Summary

The 18th edition of the annual Tech Trends report by the Future Today Strategy Group (FTSG) posits that humanity has crossed a metaphorical Rubicon. Society has entered a period characterized by sudden, irreversible technological leaps that have moved beyond established mental models, biological constraints, and social norms. The central thesis of the 2025 analysis is the emergence of **Living Intelligence**—a foundational convergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI), advanced sensors, and biotechnology. These systems do not merely process data; they sense, learn, adapt, and evolve.

The report emphasizes that the next five years are critical for the trajectory of human civilization. Organizations face a widening gap between leaders who integrate these converging technologies and laggards who remain disoriented by the pace of change. Strategic foresight is presented not as a tool for prediction, but as a mechanism for making correct decisions in a present where traditional boundaries have dissolved.

### Critical Takeaways

- **Living Intelligence:** The merging of AI, sensors, and biotech creates systems that perceive and evolve beyond human programming.
- **Action-Oriented AI:** Large Action Models (LAMs) and Agentic AI are shifting the paradigm from text generation to real-world behavior and autonomous goal-setting.
- **Physical Transformation:** Robotics and metamaterials are breaking historical limits, enabling machines to adapt to unstructured environments and substances to be engineered at the microscopic level.
- **Infrastructure Resurgence:** Massive computational demands are forcing "unlikely alliances" between tech rivals and a renaissance in nuclear energy, specifically Small Modular Reactors (SMRs).
- **New Frontiers:** Quantum computing has reached an inflection point via error correction, and private enterprise is actively colonizing cislunar space to build an extraterrestrial economy.

## The FTSG Framework for Strategic Decision-Making

To navigate the complexity of these trends, the report outlines a four-pillar framework designed to connect foresight to organizational strategy:

| Pillar                         | Objective                                                    |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Strategic Horizon Scanning** | Identifying emerging technologies that will impact growth in the next 12–36 months. |
| **Organizational Readiness**   | Evaluating if culture, talent, and processes can thrive in evolving market conditions. |
| **Risk & Disruption Mapping**  | Focusing on how technological convergence creates unexpected competitive threats. |
| **Action Planning**            | Creating dynamic response frameworks that allow organizations to pivot as change accelerates. |

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Era of Living Intelligence: AI, Sensors, and Biotech

Living intelligence represents the birth of systems that interact with and modify the physical world in real-time. This convergence creates feedback loops between digital and biological systems, pushing disruption into a new, compounding phase.

- **The Signal Gap:** Many organizations are myopically focused on AI, failing to see how sensors and biotechnology amplify AI’s impact.
- **Competitive Dynamics:** Early movers are building systems that sense market changes and evolve offerings autonomously. For example, AlphaFold Server’s free database now contains **200 million protein structures**, accelerating drug discovery and biological research.
- **Industry Applications:** Healthcare is combining diagnostics with continuous biometric monitoring, while retailers are creating environments that sense and respond to customer behavior.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Shift Toward Autonomous Action

AI is transitioning from passive tools that process language to active agents that execute complex strategies.

### Large Action Models (LAMs)

LAMs learn from behavioral data captured by sensors rather than just text.

- **Behavior Prediction:** LAMs break complex tasks into executable steps based on environmental feedback.
- **Personal Large Action Models (PLAMs):** These systems will manage tasks and negotiate deals based on individual user preferences while utilizing edge computing for privacy.
- **Scale:** By 2030, more than **125 billion connected devices** will provide the behavioral data necessary to fuel LAMs.

### Agentic AI

Agentic AI marks the move to systems that can set their own goals and orchestrate resources independently.

- **Multi-Agent Collaboration:** The true power of this trend lies in networks of specialized AI agents working together on interconnected challenges.
- **Efficiency Gains:** According to the 2024 Stanford HAI Survey, **72% of enterprises** using AI agents have achieved business process efficiency gains.
- **Coding Automation:** MIT CSAIL estimates that AI-powered agents could automate **80% of coding tasks** by 2030.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Robotics and the Built Environment

Technological advances are enabling machines and materials to transcend their previous natural and programmed limits.

### Adaptive Robotics

Robotics is hitting an inflection point where machines are no longer confined to controlled factory floors.

- **Real-Time Adaptation:** AI and advanced sensors allow robots to perceive and adapt to unstructured environments autonomously.
- **Autonomy Increase:** The convergence of these technologies is expected to increase robotic autonomy by more than **60%**, according to Boston Dynamics.
- **Economic Impact:** Siemens AG reports that AI-enabled robots in fully automated assembly lines can reduce automation costs by **90%**.

### Metamaterials

Metamaterials are substances engineered at the microscopic level to possess properties not found in nature.

- **Microscopic Design:** These materials can manipulate light, sound, heat, and mechanical stress.
- **The Built Environment:** Metamaterials enable self-cooling buildings and ultra-resilient infrastructure. For instance, acoustic metamaterials can reduce sound transmission by up to **94%**.
- **AI Integration:** AI has reduced the development time for these materials from decades to hours through simulation and optimization.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Infrastructure, Energy, and Climate Innovation

The massive energy and computational requirements of AI are reshaping the global industrial and environmental landscape.

### Unlikely Alliances (Coopetition)

The scale of AI development makes isolation impossible, forcing tech giants to share infrastructure.

- **Resource Sharing:** Strategic alliances are forming between cloud providers, chip manufacturers, and AI companies.
- **Example:** Amazon has committed up to **$4 billion** to Anthropic, embedding Claude models into AWS infrastructure.

### The Nuclear Renaissance

To secure reliable, carbon-free energy for data centers, tech companies are investing directly in nuclear power.

- **Small Modular Reactors (SMRs):** SMRs are scalable, standardized, and faster to deploy than traditional plants.
- **Direct Investment:** Microsoft is reopening a nuclear plant at Three Mile Island, renamed the **Crane Clean Energy Center**, to power its data centers.

### Climate Innovation

Extreme weather is no longer just a compliance issue; it is a driver of commercial breakthroughs.

- **Medium Term (3–7 Years):** Healthcare Systems, Pharmaceuticals, and Automotive.
- **Longer Term (7–10 Years):** Space Tech and Quantum Architecture.

The report concludes that the goal for modern leaders is not to "get the future right," but to ensure their current decisions are robust enough to withstand the accelerating shift toward a world of living intelligence.
