# **VSDP for Pharma and Medical Devices**

## For Medical Device Manufacturers

**1. Privacy-Preserving AI Training at Scale** You gain access to VSDP's federated learning network, allowing you to train and validate AI algorithms across data from hundreds of practices **without ever extracting identifiable patient data**. For example, if you make OCT machines, you could develop an algorithm for detecting early macular edema and train it on 100,000 patient digital twins without the cost and compliance headaches of centralized data lakes. This addresses HIPAA concerns while giving you the richest possible training dataset to continuously improve your device intelligence.

**2. Enhanced Device Differentiation** By integrating your hardware with VSDP, you transform from a commodity equipment seller to a holistic solution provider. Instead of just saying "our topographer measures the cornea," you can say "our machine feeds into a digital twin that predicts keratoconus progression and suggests personalized treatment timing." This differentiation matters in commoditized markets. VSDP provides APIs/SDKs so your devices can feed data into digital twins and retrieve analytic outputs—enabling new features like risk scores displayed directly on device reports.

**3. Population Data Insights & Synthetic Datasets** You can subscribe to de-identified population insights from the VSDP network. If you're a contact lens manufacturer, you could query the network for incidence of contact-lens-induced dry eye across different demographics to inform product design. VSDP can generate synthetic eye health datasets based on digital twins for your R&D use—valuable for testing algorithms or new device software without privacy concerns.

**4. Outcome-Based Selling with Real-World Evidence** VSDP helps you move toward outcome-based marketing: "Our surgical laser improves patient twins' predicted outcomes by X%." This is supported by real-world evidence from the VSDP network. Regulatory agencies increasingly want proof of real-world efficacy at scale—VSDP gives you that evidence engine.

**5. Increased Device Utilization** When practices have VSDP's predictive analytics identifying exactly which patients need which scans, they use devices more effectively. Data shows practices with VSDP may use OCT 20% more because they know when scans add value—which potentially encourages more device purchases.

**6. Recurring Revenue Pathway** Many device manufacturers want to transition from one-time equipment sales to recurring revenue models. VSDP provides the analytics layer that enables subscription services built on top of your hardware.

## For Pharmaceutical Companies

**1. Dramatically Faster Clinical Trial Recruitment** Each digital twin in VSDP captures rich longitudinal data (visual acuity, imaging metrics, risk factors). You can query the network to identify candidate patients meeting specific trial criteria—with proper consent frameworks. Developing a new glaucoma drug? Use VSDP to find patients whose twins show progressing optic nerve cupping across hundreds of practices. This improves recruitment efficiency dramatically compared to traditional methods.

**2. Virtual Control Groups & Smaller Trials** VSDP enables virtual control groups using historical digital twin data to serve as controls, reducing the number of patients needed on placebo. Companies like Unlearn.AI already use twin-based simulations to run smaller, faster trials. You could simulate how a group of digital twins with AMD might progress without treatment, as a comparator to your treated group—potentially cutting trial cost and duration significantly.

**3. Regulatory-Grade Real-World Evidence (RWE)** VSDP produces real-world outcomes data far richer than claims or registry data because digital twins track granular clinical state, not just billing codes. You could show the FDA that in 10,000 VSDP patients, your glaucoma drug slowed visual field loss by X% compared to matched digital twins not on the drug. The FDA is increasingly open to RWE for label expansions, and having ready access to millions of continuously-updated patient trajectories is a powerful asset for post-market surveillance and label expansion.

**4. Patient Finding & Phenotype Matching** VSDP's network can flag the exact phenotype you need across hundreds of clinics in real time. Instead of spending years finding patients, you can identify them in months through the digital twin infrastructure.

## Bottom Line Value Proposition

For both device and pharma manufacturers, VSDP solves the fundamental challenge of **"How do I access rich, longitudinal clinical data at scale while respecting privacy and maintaining regulatory compliance?"**

You get: immediate access to a validated clinical network, privacy-preserving analytics, continuous model improvement, competitive differentiation, and the infrastructure to transition from selling products to selling outcomes. The alternative is building all this yourself—which requires massive capital investment, years of development, and uncertain adoption.
